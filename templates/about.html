		  	<p>Aquaponics is a Closed Looped system that utilises naturally occuring processes to grow both plants and fish. By feeding the fish they produce waste (Ammonia). Bacteria break this down into Nitrates that goes on to provide nutrients for the plants. For those of you who have done some GCSE biology you might remember the nitrogen cycle.</p>
