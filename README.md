# Adam's Aquaponic Automaton

## My Dissertation

This was the result of my dissertation. I created an Aquaponic system that monitored and controlled an environment. The main components were a Raspberry Pi and Arduino that would communicate through I2C. 

I have since gone on to make a full scale version in my back garden! I love talking about it so please get in touch if you want to know more!
